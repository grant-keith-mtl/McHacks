# McHacks Project
This was my hack for McHacks 2020.
Unfortunately, I wasn't able to finish during the allotted time period, since I worked on it by myself.
I will, however, continue working on it in the coming weeks.
The goal of the application is to allow the user to plan their schedule by location as well as date and time.
The application shows markers at the locations of the events using the Goggle Maps API.
To DO:
- ~~Connect Google Maps API~~
- Add Google Places Autocomplete Inputs
- Complete New Plans Form
- Complete Dashboard Page
- Create Sign Up Page
- Add OAuth Capabilities for Email
- Connect Firebase Database to allow users to add new events and store in JSON format
